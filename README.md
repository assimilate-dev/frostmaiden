# House Rules

Some of these are house rules specific to my table and the campaign setting.
Others are just an emphasis or clarification on existing rules. It is assumed
that many of these rules will eventually become moot as the characters learn
magical spells such as Leomund's Tiny Hut and Goodberry that assist with food
and rest.

## Light

It is considered dark outside of the hours of 10AM to 2PM which provide dim
light. Checks based on sight and attack rolls are hampered by dim light and
darkness.

A torch will burn for a single hour.

## Finding food

Plant food is nearly impossible to find in the tundra. If characters need food
and they do not have rations or do not want to waste their rations they can
hunt.

Hunting DCs:

| Outcome                                           | DC    |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Hunters becomes separated from the party          | 1-5   | 
| Enough food for a single meal for a single person | 6-10  |
| Enough food for a single meal for three people    | 11-20 |
| Enough food for the entire party                  | 21+   |

Eating humanoids will incur madness penalties.

## Exhaustion and rest

When a character drops to zero hitpoints, falls unconscious, and is re-awakened
by healing; the character suffers a level of exhaustion. This does not occur
when a player is reawakened by a 20 roll on a death save or by a specific class
ability or spell such as
[Death Ward](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Death%20Ward).

Characters will roll a DC 10 CON save to avoid one level of exhaustion while
exposed to the cold:

  - after the conclusion of combat
  - after each hour during normal weather conditions
  - after each half-hour during blizzard conditions
  - after each minute while submerged in freezing water

Characters will roll a DC 10 CON save to avoid one level of exhaustion every
four hours while traveling off-road and ever four hours after concluding
off-road travel if they have not eaten.

Characters will roll a DC 10 CON save to avoid one level of exhaustion every six
hours while traveling off-road and every six hours after concluding off-road
travel if they have not taken a long rest.

## Group rolls and the help action

Group rolls will be determined by a single character. Once a character rolls an
investigation, perception, or other type of roll that will apply to the group,
no other players may attempt that roll. Players are advised to have the
character with the best chance of succeeding make the roll.

To help the party overcome the single point of failure caused by this rule,
anyone who helps on the roll will provide advantage to the roller. If the roller
succeeds the helper will receive inspiration.

In addition to the normal inspiration rules on page 125 of the Player's Handbook,
inspiration can be used to guarantee the success of an attack roll. Inspiration
expires at the end of the session following the one where it was received.

While traveling, the group will have one (or two if help is requested) Navigator
and Lookout which will handle survival and perception checks for the group.

## Winter clothing
Snowshoes and heavy clothing cause dexterity disadvantages.

## DC Clarification
Outside of an attack roll a 1 does not guarantee a failure, a 20 does not
guarantee a success, and the tie goes to the roller. In the event that the
outcome is determined by a roll-off, a tie means that nothing changes.
