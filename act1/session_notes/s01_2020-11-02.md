# Session One Notes

2020-11-02

## Cold Open

Session was opened with an explanation and clarification of specific
[house rules](https://github.com/assimilate-dev/frostmaiden/blob/main/README.md).

The world was introduced narratively in a
[cold open](https://github.com/assimilate-dev/frostmaiden/blob/main/act1/1_cold_open.txt).

## The Luskan Arms

Jim and Fastbatch met Thoval and Yzma at The Luskan Arms: a nautical-themed
tavern that had seen better days. Owenn Tarsenel, the inn-keep, was disinterested
and too depressed to engage with the characters. 

After some brief conversation, Speaker Naerth Max entered the common room of
of the inn from his room upstairs. He was engaged in conversation with a dwarf
named Shandar Froth and followed by a large tiefling named Skath and another
player character: Neville.

From the conversation that Naerth was not trying to keep quiet the players
learned the following:
  - There is an election in Good Mead for a new speaker
  - Naerth and Shandar have a business arrangement for shipping mead to Targos
  - A fisherman named Niko is upset that Osgood Dickens owes him and a lot of
    others money
	- Naerth assured Niko that everything would be worked out and that he would
    be covered

Naerth gave the characters his blessing and free reign of the town for a single
night. He made it clear that he expected the characters to move along the
following morning. He is not interested in outsiders, especially outsiders from
Bryan Shander, poking their noses around town and stirring up trouble. He
expressed no concern about the possibility of additional murders and remarked
that the murderer actually did him a favor since Osgood owed money all around
town. More than anything, Naerth is specifically interested in getting back to
the business of supplying Ten-Towns with trout.

Neville was introduced as a hired hand and was told that he would be paid twice
what the others were paid with a potential for more if he finds the killer.
Before leaving the inn, Neville challenged well-respected elder Niko to a
fishing competition.

If the players learned one thing in the inn, it's that the citizens of Targos do
not take kindly to strangers meddling in their business.

## Dickens' Custom Boats
**(00:30:00)**

The players, led by Fastbatch, decided to investigate Dickens' offices and boat
workshop on the northern dock. While in the dock-house, Fastbatch discerns that
all the boats look like they are being repaired; not built.

The house attached to the workshop is abandoned and seems to have been
unmolested. It was quiet and dark and the players entered through a door after
Jim picked the lock.

Neville cased the house, going straight for the business papers, and found that
Osgood had a business partner, Garret Velryn, and that Osgood had paid a large
sum of money five days ago to Speaker Maxildanarr.

## Three Flags Sailing
