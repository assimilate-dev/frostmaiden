## FIEVES!

![Footprints in the snow](https://images.wallpaperscraft.com/image/night_snow_mountains_121698_4000x6000.jpg)

The party is all gathered around a table in Northern Light with Torvus. Garret
and boy have gone to bed. They discuss the stolen items including the
color-changing lantern that hung on a hook out in front of the inn. The group
confirms that they've seen the same dwarf tracks as Torvus extending all the way
out to Kelvin's Cairn. The tracks are as tiny as Jim's feet but made by
something heavier.

Talking to Allie, Cori, and Torvus it is clear that the people of Caer Konig
don't have much except bad news:
- There was a fur trader that showed up alone in Good Mead without his family
- There is the serial murderer who has killed in Bryn Shander, Targos, and Easthaven
- Talking wolves killing travelers in Dougan's Hole
- A wizard in Easthaven has been jailed a tenday ago for killing townsfolk

What little they do have is now under threat by the thieves. Other than Glenn
at Hook, Line, and Sinker who has made a deal with the dwarves, nobody in town
has booze. Mead was shipped from Good Mead on the ferry which is now shut down
because the ice makes the hourney dangerous. The people of Caer Konig feel
abandoned by Ten-Towns.

Torvus feels responsible as the speaker to affect what he can and catch the
thieves. His legacy as speaker is all he has left after his adventuring days.
He hopes things don't get worse before he can make them better. He hopes that
the murderer doesn't come to Caer Konig.

Torvus offers a troutmeal dinner, free lodging, and his magical breastplate that
he got from his adventuring days in an attempt to bribe the characters to help
him take care of the thieves at Kelvin's Cairn. IF nothing else Torvus asks
characters to put in a good word with SPeaker Shane in the "big city" of Bryn
Shander to get the ferry restarted.

Torvus' [breastplate](https://www.dndbeyond.com/equipment/breastplate) is a +1
breaastplate with magical glyphs on the surface that will glow and vibrate when
the wearer is within 120 ft. of a dragon. He notes it would be handy if you
happened upon White Widow sleeping under a pile of snow; though she prefers elk
and bear to the taste of human.

After much back and forth Torvus makes a deal with Fastbatch. He'll let him
borrow the breastplate now while he sets out to find the murderer but then he
must come back right away and help Torvus track down the thieves. He also
promises renown and free lodging

Titus initially ignores Torvus' comments about the fur trader with the missing
family but inquires more deeply once the others have retired.

In her room, Yzma pulls out the note she received from Naerth and attempts to
forge a copy. She leaves the spot blank where her name would. The forgery roll
will happen when she tries to pass off the forgery.

Before heading to bed, Fastbatch drops off a letter for Speaker Shane in the
Palms Passing drop-box which is protected with runes. When he gets back to the
inn, Allie warns him about Titus. She says everyone deserves a second chance
but there have been some vicious rumors about him. Allie tells Fastbatch to
keep an eye open. Fastbatch inquires about her marital status and she claims to
be married to a fisherman who wakes up early for work.

## Beyond the wall of sleep

Once the charaters retire for the evening, each has a chance to reflect on the
events of the previous day.

### Thoval

Thoval drifts into a blissful state somewhere between the waking world and the realm
of sleep. The scrimshaw horn he was given has sparked both a
nostalgic yearning for home but also a boyish dream to conquer the wilds and
fulfill the mandate of his ancestors.

He thinks of home, Wyrmdoom Crag, and his clan, Thuunlakalaga. His thoughts
soar across Icewind Dale and through the immense, jagged peaks of the Spine of
the World. These proud people felled an ancient white dragon to claim their
ancestral home. It's skeletal remains still lie in the crag as a testament to their
triumph. Right now the clan is likely returning to the great hall after a
rousing game of goatball, preparing to feast and be regaled by stories from the
chieftain, Ogalai Orcsplitter Thuunlakalaga; her axe haft made from a dragon's
bone.

He thinks about what it means to be a goliath. One day he hopes to
return and crawl through the rune-carved tunnel, face his inner demons, and
emerged cleansed and marked as a tribal elder.

He thinks about the feud between his people and the the Akkanathi goliaths of
Skytower. The grudge began when a griffin from Skytower grievously wounded a
Thuunlakalaga competitor during a goatball exhibition. A devastating insult but
one that has been holding back inter-clan unity for decades. If the two clans
could be united, perhaps their combined might could be harnessed to hep defeat
Auril.

He thinks of his favorite story from his days as a young one in the great
hall: The Legend of Golyat. Golyat Trollcrusher Ekron-Ashkalon Thuunlakalaga was
gigantic even by goliath measures. Standing at 7’10” tall and weighing in at
380 lbs., Golyat was carved from the same stone that makes up the mountains
surrounding Wyrmdoom Crag.

The story goes that Golyat’s village was being besieged by a vicious and
deformed two-headed ice troll, but as others in his tribe gathered their weapons
and wits, Golyan never hesitated, leaping on to the back of the troll, grabbing
tightly, one arm locked around each of the trolls necks.

The troll clawed wildly at Golyan, who still latched to its back crushed its
neck and choked the air from its lungs. The writhing and thrashing lasted for
what legends grew to say was days, as the troll’s vaunted abilities kept him
upright and in the fight. But in the end, Golyan crushed that troll.

From that point forward, Golyan was recognized as his tribe’s greatest fighter,
known for going straight into an opponent, no matter the size. During one
battle, Golyan received a fatal injury, but rather than force his tribe to
endure the burden of his weakened state, Golyan alone slipped away in the cold
of the night.

Near the brink of death, Golyan was discovered by a mysterious figure who
plunged his fists hard into Golyan’s chest. It was Oyaminatorok; his fists
burned like they were blazing with fire and the heat surged through his entire
body, but miraculously, Golyan awoke the next day, fully healed and blessed with
the polar lycanthropy.

As he finally drift off to sleep, hr feels the kind presence of a ghostly
ancestor sitting across from the room. Watching over him. Now, and forever.

### Yzma

A short while after drifting off to sleep, Yzma recognizes the bite of ice
beneath her feet. The chill wind whips around her whole being. As usual, she is
unphased by the cold. That's fortuitous as she is now standing stark naked on
the frozen shallows of Lac Dinneshire.

Before her, a heavy obsidian table top darker than the natural darkness
outdoors. It has no legs and undulates almost imperceptibly under the force of
some type of levitation. Behind the table is a tall figure that strikes a
strange silhouette. The creature has the trappings of a human, two eyes but each
is a deep void with no whites. A sharp nose above a mouth of thin lips that hint
at enlarged canines hidden beneath. It has four horns, two on each side, which
twist around each other and trace the crown of its head. Sitting on top of the
horns is a neatly combed hairstyle. Golden jewels peak out from underneath a
neat, white suit in a style which you've never seen. Beneath it's hooves the ice
melts, bubbles, and refreezes. Everything smells intensely of sulfur.

The devil's name is Erzanad. He does not yet even know his true master. This is
a form of insurance for the rules of the Nine Hells.

Erzanad tells Yzma that her master and the council have been please with her
work. He informs her that they are offering her a familiar in exchange for her
agreement to a contract.

He uncorks a scroll protector, slides out a roll of fresh parchment, unties a
golden strand binding the roll, and unfruls it.

The contract reads:

>Yzma hereinafter known as the party of the first part does enter into contract
>with The Subjugator who shall not be named and will hereinafter be referred to
>as the party of the second part.
>
>The party of the second part hereby grants the party of the first part a
>non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, license covering access to the
>original and modified forms of The Arcanum of the Hells. Modifications to the
>work that do not automatically fall under the terms of this package, but
>belong to whomever generated them, may be distributed subject to the
>combination of the  contributor and the creating author.
>
>The following agreement is covered only if the party of the first part does
>not fail to comply with the subjugation agreement subsection B paragraph 18
>recreated here in it's entirety for reference:
>
>The practitioner of infernal arts must, at least once during a ten day span,
>forcibly acquire eight hours of time from a victim of their choosing not
>afforded voluntarily by the victim.
>
>Here victim means an innocent by the standards of human law that has no
>previous relationship with the practitioner.
>
>During this aforementioned time of subjugation the practitioner must apply to
>the victim by force one form of mental anguish as defined by the standard of
>The Manual of Torture by the inquisitors of the Tanar'ri including but not
>limited to:
>
>- oxygen deprivation force-feeding blinding with light impalement of the hands
>- or feet pitch-capping hypothermia
>
>The victim must both during and after remain cognizant of the subjugation.
>
>Failure to comply will result in revocation of privileges afforded by the
>infernal contract and infringement upon the fundamental rights of the party of
>the first part.

Before signing, Yzma negotiates a 12 day time span instead of a 10 day span as
outlined in the contract. Plus she receives a single IOU in the event that she
fails to deliver once within a 12-day period.

Erzanad reaches inside of his jacket pocket and produces two items that seem to
large to have been contained without some type of magic. The first is a vicious
dagger, it's hilt wrapped in a brown, aged leather that still shows the tattoos
on the skin of the one living host. The curved dagger blade is forged from a
glistening, red-tinted steel. The second item is a quill pen, the feather from
some unidentified creature reflects opalescent light as it catches the waning
reflection from Auril's aurora overhead.

To sign, both Erzanad on behalf of his master and Yzma pierce the center of
their hand with the dagger and sign the contract using their blood on the quill
pen. Immediately after signing, Erzanad bows and the whole scene disappears.

Yzma is left alone on the shores.

### Neville

At some point during the night Neville awakens from his slumber. An icy draft
sneaks under the piles of blankets on his bed. Eventually, he realizes that the
window in his room is open.

It doesn't take him long to realize his bagpipes have been stolen. Looking out
the window, he sees Yzma returning from the lake. THere are footsteps in the
snow piles on the roof outside of his window.

## I'm not explaining my personality to you, sir

HE goes and harasses Allie. Bangs on the door. Wakes her up. Yells at her that it's her fault for the bagpipes being stolen and he needs them back immediately.
Allie apologizes and tells Neville that is likely the thieves and she will help him find speaker Torvus. The terror is ratcheded up when Neville casts Dancing LIghts to make himself a glowing avatar.
Allie runs terrified barefoot through the snow in her bed clothes screaming for Torvus. She heads across to Hook Line and Sinker

Yzma returns totally naked but is largely uninterested in the situation

Titus and Jim wakeup. Titus comes out of his room. Asks Yzma what's going on and tells her to go get dressed. Yzma, mood ruined, retires.
Jim just kind of chills in his room.

Titus throws his clothes on and follows NEville who is running after Allie.

The tavern is in its normal reverly when the crew arrives.
The first person to try and attempt to help Allie is Glenn
I NEED MY PIPES intimidation succeeds against Glenn
All reverly in the tavern stopss, Glenn runs inside to get Torvus

Neville walks in and starts throwing sparks and flashes of lights and cracks of sound all over the bar
Some of these break glasses, people are yelling and running and trying to escape

Torvus tries to connect on an adventurer level and calm Neville down
It doesn't work
Fortunately for everyone Titus arrives
TItus's presence seems to ease the situation
Torvus tells Neville about the deal that Fastbatch knows where they are. And asks NEville to fastforward his request to Fastbatch. He'd be more than happy to do it now.

Titus and Neville have a long conversation about appropriate levels of response to anger.

Cori does her due diligence but is obviously upset at the party for the events of the previous night
Plus all of the furniture is rearranged in a strange way putting more work on her
Fastbatch gets a special treat

Jim does get a smile out of Cori.

The whole crew learns of the events last night. NEville gives a half apology but is still quite upset about his bagpipes.

Jim's feet are bound. Its canon. His feet were bound because of his culture.

Ration purchasing before everyone leaves from Frozenfar. They have also heard about the events from the previous night and don't want to give favorable prices to the characters but THoval works his magic.

Garret stays behind at the request of the party since he is the only eye witness to Osgood's murder. He leaves boy at Frozenfar Expiditions because they are the closest things to vetrinarians.

(He is going to have to kill boy eventually)


## Winter Lambs
Two hours trip along an inhospitable path tracing the shore of Lac Dinnshire to Caer Dineval
Lots of shouts and roars yetis crag ats other creatures

If you thought Caer Konig was small, welcome to Caer Dineval

Everything looks ramshackle

THey recognize her as the author of Hellbent Highborn
He is ecstatic to meet her. He invites her to be guest of honor at the castle where there is wine and cheese and food and feasting and beds and warmth.
Yzma tell him the party is her servants. Finest lodging outside of Bryn Shander
He tells her that they will light fires even though the rest of the town sacrifices warmth. This raises the ire of the one that the party believes to be the murderer.
He tells her the password is in Infernal "Churning Blood"

HE tells them that they may have business propositions
Yzma hints he may name a character after him

Fastbatch concocts a plan to talk to the killer.

THe killer tells Fastbatch that he kills people who ignore sacrifices
