## Reghed Glacier

The Reghed Glacier is a glacial wasteland north of the Spine of the World. The
region is so desolate and isolated that few travelers dare venture atop it.
The Reghed Glacier forms the eastern boundary of Icewind Dale and is bordered
by the Spine of the World to the south.

## Chardalyn

A chardalyn (pronounced: CHAR-dah-lin is a rare, naturally occurring substance
mined in nugget form in Icewind Dale.

When first discovered , these oval-shaped black stones were described as
"useless rocks" by miners, but their affinity for magic was soon discovered.
These nuggets were as brittle as glass and turned into a powder when they were
forcefully struck or when hurled against a solid object.

Chardalyn is a powerful crystalline substance that can fetch a high price in the
right markets. Because it can absorb and store magic, Chardalyn has been used to
create many weapons and spell focuses. However, chardalyn has been known to
become suffused with demonic or infernal magic it is nearby to corrupting
sources.
