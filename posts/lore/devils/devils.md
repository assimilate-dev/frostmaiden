## Yzma's contract

Yzma hereinafter known as the party of the first part does enter into contract
with The Subjugator who shall not be named and will hereinafter be referred to
as the party of the second part.

The party of the second part hereby grants the party of the first part a
non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, license covering access to the original
and modified forms of The Arcanum of the Hells. Modifications to the work that
do not automatically fall under the terms of this package, but belong to
whomever generated them, may be distributed subject to the combination of the 
contributor and the creating author.

The following agreement is covered only if the party of the first part does not
fail to comply with the subjugation agreement subsection B paragraph 18
recreated here in it's entirety for reference:

The practitioner of infernal arts must, at least once during a ten day span,
forcibly acquire eight hours of time from a victim of their choosing not
afforded voluntarily by the victim.

Here victim means an innocent by the standards of human law that has no previous
relationship with the practitioner.

During this aforementioned time of subjugation the practitioner must apply to
the victim by force one form of mental anguish as defined by the standard of The
Manual of Torture by the inquisitors of the Tanar'ri including but not limited
to:

- oxygen deprivation
- force-feeding
- blinding with light
- impalement of the hands or feet
- pitch-capping
- hypothermia

The victim must both during and after remain cognizant of the subjugation.

Failure to comply will result in revocation of privileges afforded by the
infernal contract and infringement upon the fundamental rights of the party of
the first part.
