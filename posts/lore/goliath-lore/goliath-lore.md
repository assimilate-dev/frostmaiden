## Overview

Wyrmdoom Crag is home to the Thuunlakalaga clan of Goliaths. The crag is nested inside the immense, jagged peaks of the Spine of the World. These proud people felled an ancient white dragon to claim their ancestral home. It's skeletal remains still lie in the crag as a testament to their triumph. Their chieftain is Ogalai Orcsplitter Thuunlakalaga. Her axe haft made from a dragon's bone.

Elder goliaths must survive the encounter in the rune-carved tunnel where they face inner demons. If they make it through, they emerge cleansed and marked as a tribal elder.

Clan Thuunlakalaga feuds with the Akkanathi clan goliaths of Skytower. The grudge began when a griffin from Skytower grievously wounded a Thuunlakalaga competitor during a goatball exhibition. A devastating insult but one that has been holding back inter-clan unity for decades. If the two clans could be united, perhaps their combined might could be harnessed to hep defeat Auril.

## The Legend of Golyat

One of the most famous stories of Clan Thuunlakalaga is _The Legend of Golyat_. Golyat Trollcrusher Ekron-Ashkalon Thuunlakalaga was gigantic even by goliath measures. Standing at 7’10” tall and weighing in at 380 lbs., Golyat was carved from the same stone that makes up the mountains surrounding Wyrmdoom Crag.

The story goes that Golyat’s village was being besieged by a vicious and deformed two-headed ice troll, but as others in his tribe gathered their weapons and wits, Golyat never hesitated, leaping on to the back of the troll, grabbing tightly, one arm locked around each of the trolls necks.

The troll clawed wildly at Golyat, who still latched to its back crushed its neck and choked the air from its lungs. The writhing and thrashing lasted for what legends grew to say was days, as the troll’s vaunted abilities kept him upright and in the fight. But in the end, Golyat crushed that troll.

From that point forward, Golyat was recognized as his tribe’s greatest fighter, known for going straight into an opponent, no matter the size. During one battle, Golyat received a fatal injury, but rather than force his tribe to endure the burden of his weakened state, Golyat alone slipped away in the cold of the night.

Near the brink of death, Golyat was discovered by a mysterious figure who plunged his fists hard into Golyat’s chest. It was Oyaminatorok; his fists burned like they were blazing with fire and the heat surged through his entire body, but miraculously, Golyat awoke the next day, fully healed and blessed with the polar lycanthropy.
