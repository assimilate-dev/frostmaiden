## How did we get here?

I'm happy that everyone is back in the same room and I am happy that everyone,
if you play your cards right, will be conscious for the whole session.

You are in a castle with cultists dedicated to Levistus. One of their leaders,
Hethyl, died after delivering you a message. Weird timing, huh? You killed
another leader by pushing him off a boat, encasing him in a block of ice, and
decapitating him. The only other person of power nearly killed two of you with
ease before leaving the castle; seemingly unconcerned about the chaos you
unleashed.

During the last two sessions each of you have separately uncovered some
interesting nuggets of information that, put together, form in interesting
narrative:

- The cultists took Caer Dineval by force, the speaker was not a willing participant
- You've been told that the Rime is concealing a powerful, sinister force
- Yzma has noticed Fastbatch's strange obsession with collecting amulets
- Titus encountered a profound evil buried in Jim's subconscious

The problem is you each learned them separately. Separately none of these things
are particularly informative. Will you share what you have learned?

Right now you are holed up in Kadroth's quarter with all known entrances and
exits barricaded. The blizzard is still raging outside. Two of you, Titus and
Thoval, are conscious. Thoval you have the head of the Tiefling and the head of
Sephek in your backpack. Your key witness against Sephek, Garrett Velryn, is
back in Caer Konig. The others are bound and unconscious. Fastbatch you are
wearing Torvus' breastplate which comes with the implicit promise to root out
the same Duergar that concern the knights. With you are five others:

- Lanthis Alderdusk, Speaker Crannoc's assistant
- Elprekt Norbrav, an old butler
- Mylbara Norbrav, the speaker's translator
- Tam Sharf, a mute housemaid
- Allasar

Outside of the room you assume there are somewhere between 25 and 30 hostile
cultists who are also regrouping.

## Setting realistic goals

You've only been together for three days and four nights and you've narrowly
avoided a self-inflicted TPK.

None of you ever need to be friends for this campaign to work. I suspect that
at several points in the future you will come into conflict again. You don't
have to be friends, but it would behoove each of you to align on goals. You will
absolutely disagree on how you should achieve your goals, but you can desire the
same outcome without consensus on the means

I don't believe that any of you currently align with Levistus but he does want
you to kill Duergar which aligns nicely with what Speaker Torvus has asked of
you.

Before you can align on goals, however; you need to decide what your goals are.
Think about that for a second... What do each of you want... really? If you're
traveling around direction-less then Icewind Dale will chew you up and spit you
out. But if you have some real desire, it is likely you need to make friends and
allies to help get you there. As a DM I hope those friends are your current
traveling companions. Hwoever, adding allies in the Speaker's Guild or even an
infernal cult could be beneficial to you at some point in the future.

What I am saying is that traveling around pissing of townsfolk, speakers, cults,
and each other is not a recipe for success.

## Titus needs a drink

Titus you are starting to shake. Half of all foodstuffs have been spoiled.
