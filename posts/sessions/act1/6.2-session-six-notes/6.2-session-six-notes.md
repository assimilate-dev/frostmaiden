## And there was a firefight...

Fastbatch starts a fight with the killer who hits back hard and [misty
steps](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Misty%20Step#content) into a nearby
building. While the group fights the killer, Yzma hangs back and finds a dead
body stowed away amongst the caravan goods. As the characters enter the guild
hall, the killer is on the dais offering a prayer to Auril.

> "Auril, accept the sacrifices I am about to offer to you. May their blood give
you strength. We thank you Auril for your protection against greater evils and
gladly accept the hardships you place upon us. Take their strength Auril and use
it to convalesce each day as you rest from your nightly flight."

The fight is hectic and ends with the is killer dead. Jim is unconscious from a
long fall. Neville is down with grievous wounds. Fastbatch, Thoval, and Titus
are staring at a druidic spirit that has emerged from the killer's lifeless
body. The spirit whispers to Titus that he could be of service and to meet in
Lonelywood. She hands Titus a gem that has the phases of the moon carved into
it. It provides +1 to arcana checks and enables the wielder to cast moonbeam
once per day. The stone requires attunement.

Investigating the killer's frozen body turns up the following:

- A ceremonial pouch containing:
  - Bone dice and strong herbs
  - Golden signet ring with letter D
  - Fine, well worn knife with a gut-hook and unintelligible language on handle
  - Proof of purchase for a number of nights at Northlook Inn
- License to harvest wood from Axeheart Logging in Lonelywood
- His name is Sephek Kaltro

The spirit disappears and a mighty blizzard picks up outside.

## Cleaning up the mess

The hall is full of Torg's caravan members and their dogs baying at the
characters trapped on the catwalk. They have Jim tied up but stabilized. The
snow and wind begin to pick up. A blizzard is rolling in. The bench that was on
fire is extinguished from the weather blowing through the broken window.

Yzma hides in a corner and observes the situation.

Torg calls out to the group to negotiate. She will trade Jim for 60 gold pieces
since her man, Sephek, is presumed dead. Titus is able to talk her down to 40
gold pieces. The group throws together 40 gold to pay Torg and the caravan
leaves.

## Foul weather

Fastbatch tells the group that, during the fight, he saw a dead or sleeping man
in another room in the guild hall. Outside of the room is a table that seems to
protect the papers lying on top from blowing away the wind. Titus collects the
papers.

Upon inspection the man in the room is determined to be dead. Fastbatch
performs the medicine check and feels the spirit of the body reach out and yell
"In the desk!" from the afterlife.

The room has two doors, one window, and a staircase. The second door leads to an
outdoor courtyard surrounded by a stone wall. The stairs lead the other three
levels of the guild hall tower which seem to be residences.

The room is warm from a fire in the hearth but inspection shows the wood in the
hearth is not being consumed. The flame is magical and slowly losing it's
magical power. It is warm but not burning.

Fastbatch looks in the desk and finds a strange gem along with a note that
mentions his name from Doctor Wilhelm Funten.

> "If you are reading this, good. You've found the penumbral core. There are
those who would seek to undermine the Ten-Towns. The allies of order must band
together. We will find you, Fastbatch. Be on the lookout.""

Fastbatch stares at the gem to see a white ring reflected against a deep blue,
nearly black, background. While staring at the gem, Fastbatch unknowingly casts
detect magic. He notices the magical table, the fire, and a [Brooch of
Shielding](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Brooch%20of%20Shielding#content)
around the neck of the body.

The group blocks all the entrances and rests while exploring the residences. They
find:

- References to a group known as The Three Feathers
- The symbol of the feathers which is also on the outside of the hall
- Tabards displaying a white ring on a deep blue, almost black, background
- A reference to a weather controlling device called Summer Star intended to end the Rime

Everyone that is not unconscious takes a short rest. The unconscious wake up
after the short rest with 1 HP. The group decides not to burn wood to avoid
suspicion in a town that makes a warmth sacrifice. Despite the short rest, the
group is having a tough time.

## Up the hill to the caer

The party has three general directions to follow:
- Head to Bryn Shander to collect their reward
- Go back to Caer Konig to help Torvus as promised
- Accept the invitation to Castle (Caer) Dineval

They decide on the latter for a few reasons:

- Inclimate weather
- The group should have Garret as a witness before collecting the reward
- The path back to Caer Konig is dangerous; especially in a blizzard

The group discusses how the feel about Yzma's absence with Yzma present. She
contends she would have helped if needed. Yzma tells the group about the dead
body in the caravan.

Before leaving, Thoval saws off and stashes Sephek's strangely frozen head. He
stashes the body in a nearby snow bank as they leave.

The characters brave the weather and climb the hill to the caer. Yzma speaks the
code words to enter the castle: "Churning Blood" in Infernal. As the gates open
their guide, Adelfo Hannelore. Adelfo takes them through the outdoor courtyard
where the party spots a young boy living in the cold amongst the guard dogs.

The castle is home to The Black Swords. The Swords all wear a polished black
stone in the shape of a sword. Each has a different background but they have all
been saved by a higher power after a near-death experience. Four important
members of the Sword are mentioned:

- Kadroth, the leader of The Black Swords
- Hethyl, a sage and the matron of the Swords
- Avarice, a wizard and member of The Arcane Brotherhood
- Crannoc Siever, Speaker of Caer Dineval

Adelfo states that everyone is welcome to stay as long as they want and to make
themselves at home. The only limitation imposed is to respect locked doors. The
party is led through the main hall where a feast is being prepared. Their room
is next to Hethyl who they are encouraged to visit.

Yzma finds out that The Swords know a lot about arch-devils from the old Dinev
library in the castle. The member speak regularly to Levistus.
