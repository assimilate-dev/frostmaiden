## Mission accomplished

Sephek Kaltro was a well-built man in his thirties. He had an olive complexion.
His dark hair was pulled into a ponytail but he seemingly had no other facial or
body hair. When you confronted him he was dressed in a stylish vest with
matching pants and boots; similar to the style worn by mariners of the northern
Sword Coast. He wore no armor. He didn't appear to be carrying a weapon.

Investigating the killer's frozen body turns up the following a ceremonial pouch
containing:

- Bone dice and strong herbs
- Golden signet ring with letter D
- Fine, well worn knife with a gut-hook and unintelligible language on handle
- Proof of purchase for a number of nights at Northlook Inn

Aside from the pouch he carried:

- 27 gold pieces and a handful of silver
- A license for Sephek Kaltro to harvest wood from Axeheart Logging in Lonelywood

Your newfound fortune did not last for long. Torg insisted that you owe her
reparations for the loss of a member of her caravan which you paid after a
successful negotiation. She did have Jim dead to rights as a bargaining chip.

## The Three Feathers

The guild hall in Caer Dineval where you engaged with Sephek belongs to a group
of adventures who call themselves The Three Feathers. Ask anyone in the
settlement and you'll find that the trio has an out-sized reputation. In better
days, the adventurers brought treasure, renown, and protection to what was then
a burgeoning town. The group was led by Dr. Wilhem Funten, a fighter from
Chessenta. He and his associates Macreadus (an artificer) and Vellynne Harpell
(a wizard) comprised The Three Feathers and were associated with The Penumbra.

The Penumbra are well known as champions of the paupers and thorns in the side
of the ruling classes. They operate in a decentralized manner via cells where
they interact and share information with one another. The Penumbra's purpose is
noble, they manipulate those in power into doing what needs to be done for the
benefit of all.

While snooping through their private quarters you found:

- papers detailing Macreadus' work on a device known as Summer Star
- a magical table protecting a disheveled stack of papers
- a brooch of shielding on Dr. Wilhelm Funten, who had died

There was a time when dalefolk looked to The Three Feathers to save them from
Auril's Rime. Unfortunately, the three elder statesmen were too frail to engage.

## Bluster

The battle is over. Sephek is dead. The druidic spirit has passed from his body.
As if by coincidence, a dangerous blizzard storms into town.

> "We had discovered an accursed country. We had found the Home of the
Blizzard." - Douglas Mawson

A blizzard has a way of changing plans. Hunkering down in the breached guild
hall or returning to Bryan Shander is now much less enticing. You decided to
accept the hospitality of Garion Valere and spend the night in the castle.

## The lost boys

The Knights of the Black Sword are a secretive group that count among their
membership:

- Speaker of Caer Dineval, Crannoc Siever
- Kadroth, the tiefling who leads the knights
- Hethyl Arkorran, the matron mother of the knights
- Avarice, an albino tiefling with The Arcane Brotherhood

The other members you speak to are Icewind Dale natives and each has a story
where they would have perished in the wilderness has a great power not
intervened. All stories are the same: they were reached out to in their minds as
they were freezing to death. The disembodied voice offered a second chance at
life in exchange for their devotion. Shortly after, a pale glow caught their eye
in the snow, leading to the discovery of the sword-shaped amulet of chardalyn.
Each of these amulets has an inner radiance that provides warmth and aid,
protecting its wearer against the cold while guiding them safely back to
civilization.

The members display their amulets proudly and are all well-versed in esoteric
knowledge of infernals, to whom they claim to speak.

Chardalyn. 

You've been shown around the grounds of the caer. You've been given free access
as if it was your home so long as you respect the privacy of others. You've been
placed in a well-appointed, warm room directly across from the matron mother,
Hethyl, and encouraged to visit with her. But please be quiet in the hallway. In
a few hours, you are all invited to dinner with the knights where Yzma will be
the guest of honor.
