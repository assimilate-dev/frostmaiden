## A fire in the sky

The session begins on the shores of Lac Dinneshire in a shack. Everyone is tired and cold and mostly exhausted. Titus' unconscious body begins to convulse. Wrapping him in more clothing fails to stop his shaking. Yzma manages to collect enough wood to create a fire. Smoke fills the ceiling of the shack but it is drafty enough that the party can breath with a fire inside.

While the group is engaged with these various activities, Neville is the first to notice a bright light peeking through the cracks of the shanty walls. Eventually Jim and Thoval notice it as well. Peeking through they see an otherworldly, metal craft floating in the sky emanating a pulsating light. A sled slowly approaches the object from across the lake. As it gets close, the sled, it's driver, and dogs begin to levitate towards the source of the light. Shortly after it blinks out of existence.

## Reputation

The group witnessing the tableau outside is knocked unconscious and wakes several hours later to a knock at the door. There are guards outside because no fires are allowed this night: it is the town's sacrifice to Auril. The group plus the speaker's staff from the castle are able to convince the guards that they saved the town. The guard changes his stance and escorts the group to Speaker Crannoc.

Crannoc Siever is in his office waiting for the crew. He thanks them for rescuing him and promises to put in a good word for the group with the other towns. He is excited about having an adventuring party in town since The Three Feathers have left.

- Crannoc believes that a more powerful fell magic is responsible for the ill-fate of Icewind Dale
- Two wizards have been captured in Easthaven
- The first is set to be executed in two days
- The other has been sent to Revel's End, a maximum security prison out in the tundra
- The amulets have a corrupting influence on anyone who touches them

## The Uphill Climb

The Uphill climb is the only establishment in town. It sits along the the steep path from the town to the caer. There is no activity that can be seen from the outside of the castle.

The tavern has no booze because the Easthaven ferry has stopped running. The proprietor, Roark, has a wife who is able to provide aid to the still unconscious Titus. Roark and his wife June are both quite concerned about the outsized affect that the amulets are having on Fastbatch and Jim. June recommends they go see a healer at the All Faith's Shrine in Easthaven to be freed of the curse.

## Easthaven

The party leaves Allassar with the people of Caer Dineval and head to Easthaven in an attempt to cure Fastbatch and Jim of their curse. Along the way, they notice that half of their rations have spoiled; turning to a fine dust.

At the east end of The East Way is Easthaven. A boomtown where pickpocketing is legal. The town is abuzz about the two arrested wizards. THere are other rumors the townspeople are speaking about:

- There was a shipwreck on the coast far to the northwest which caused the crew to resort to cannibalism
- The one wizard that wasn't shipped off Revel's End is being held in Town Hall

The group travels to the All Faith's Shrine where they meet a lithe elf. The elf offers food, water, and shelter in exchange for a hard day's work. The party simple pays him for his services to remove the curse from FAstbatch and Jim. The priest explains that chardalyn is prized for it's ability to capture magic but lately he has seen the stone absorb demonic magic; likely from a nearby influence. The amulets are left at the shrine for safe keeping. THe priest asks the characters to retrieve the magical cauldron that was seized by a hag who lives in a cave nearby along the lakeside.
