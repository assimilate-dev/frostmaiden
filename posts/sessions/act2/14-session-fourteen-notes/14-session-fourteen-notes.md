## The Duergar Threat is Real

The session begins mid-combat. Five duergar have destroyed the chardalyn
figurehead in an attempt to steal it. During the encounter the party learns
that duergar:
- Enlarge themselves
- Communicate via some psychic link
- Have advantage against most types of magic

Shortly after the fight concludes, Danneth returns back with several guards. He
expresses gratitude and offers the party permanent employment. There have been
no adventurers to work in Icewind Dale since the Three Feathers. Danneth
offers lodging in the town hall as there isn't much space locally  due to
execution. Danneth asks the group to go close the book on Sephek in Lonelywood.

The group officially names themselves: Feather Team Six.

After the encounter:
- Titus walks off to blow off steam
- Neville asks about Auril and the All Faiths Shrine
- Yzma, Fastbatch, and Jim go investigate the duergar
- Thoval asks Danneth if he can get an armor upgrade

## The Frostmaiden

Danneth reveals the following information about Auril which he knows because of
his position as town speaker:
- The nightly spell takes a lot out of her
- She spends each day resting somewhere on the sea of the moving ice
- The sea of moving ice is difficult if not impossible to navigate
- The Three Feathers were searching for her
  - Wilhelm is in Caer Dineval and may know more
  - Vellynne Harpell travels about with kobolds
  - Macreadus was working on a device to end the rime: The Summer Star
- The gods seem to not care

## The Shrine and the Ferry

Neville discovers that the priest at the shrine was acquainted with Macreadus.
The Three Feathers member was last known to live in Lonelywood but has since
disappeared; assumed to be out in the woods surrounding the town.

He offers to indoctrinate Neville into the church of Ilmater using a
cat-of-nine-tails but Neville politely declines. Neville pays for healing.

Yzma and Fastbatch uncover small footprints and severed iron bars on the side
of the town hall. They track the prints to the ferry. Yzma and Fastbatch and
Jim board the ferry looking for information on the duergar. Yzma searches the
ferry quarters, finds a map, and gets knocked on the head by a duergar.

The duergar grabs the map, shrinks himself to the size of a mouse, and tries
to escape. A situation ensues.

Eventually the three capture the duergar netting the map and two magical items:

*Gavel of Tenebrosity.* A rare warpick that requires attunement. The wearer
gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon in dim
light or darkness. Additionally, they gain +3 to stealth checks in dim light or
darkness.

*Ring of Recognition.* The following applies to the wearer: aAnyone you meet
who you've never met before, doesn't know your name, and isn't hostile towards
you regards you as a distant, almost-forgotten acquaintance.

Thoval is offered a chain shirt.

## Dzaan in the Dungeon

D'zaan has been jailed for killing townspeople that he paid to find a tower out
in the tundra. His partner, Vaelish Gant, was captured in Bryn Shander and sent
to Revel's End.

Danneth and two guards escort Thoval and Titus into the dungeon where D'zaan is
being held. Titus speaks to him telepathically. Titus pulls the following
information from the imprisoned wizard.
- Vaelish doesn't know what D'zaan knows
- Vaelish and D'zaan's partnership was one of convenience
- Vaelish was also de-handed and de-tongued but sent to prison at Revel's End
- D'zaan knows the spire location but the other information he gained was lost
  - D'zaan burns the spire location into Titus' mind
  - The spire is a shard from the lost city of Netheril
- He was attacked in a weakened state by barbarians driven mad by Auril's magic
  - The barbarians took D'zaan's notebook to their home east of the spire
  - He will pay "handsomely" for the notebooks return
- He burns the location of the spire into his Titus mind
- D'zaan asks Titus to say four words to one of the guards: "Your mother has arrived"
- The Rime is keeping him from finding the city

After the conversation, Titus reports D'zaan's request and the guard mentioned
to Danneth. He suggests that the guard mentioned by D'zaan to be jailed though
the guard swears by his innocence and loyalty to Easthaven. Titus gets Danneth
to move up the time of the execution. Danneth asks him to go announce the time
change at The Wet Trout.

## The Wet Trout

The ferry group takes a short rest.

Fastbatch ties up the duergar, wraps him in cloth, and hauls him out on a sled.
Jim drapes an unconscious Yzma over his shoulder. They encounter guards along the
way but are able to talk their way out of it by explaining both passed out from
heavy drinking. The guards escort them for  "safety" but do not allow the sled
inside of the town hall.

Thoval and Titus head to the tavern to tell everyone that the execution has
been moved to tonight. Inside a bard is spinning a yarn:

_"Jarlmoot: a circle of giant thrones form a ring atop a haunted hillock. 
On night of the full moon the spirit of Reggaryarva, Jarl of Jarls, will open
his treasure vault to anyone who defeats him. Seven empty ice-glazed thrones
form a ring. The apparitions of dead giants, Jarls, appear in the thrones and
their eyes glow white in the darkness. They speak:
Snatch a scale from a sleeping wyrm;
Against the blowing wind stand firm.
Climb a mountain with a stone in your shoe;
On little feet, death comes for you.
Be the arrow that starts the war;
Let life's blood fall till it falls no more."_

After the show, Titus tells everyone that the execution was moved up and
everyone quickly shuffles out in an attempt to get the best seats possible.
Titus and Thoval stay and drink

The other group questions the duergar and finds out the following:
- The duergar is named Durth Sunblight
- Duergar are collecting all the chardalyn they can find
- They are forging the chardalyn into a magical, mechanical dragon
- The duergar fortress is in the mountains to the southeast
- Xardorok is the leader of the duergar and Durth's father
- Xardorok is working in service of Asmodeus

After questioning, Yzma tortures Durth. She regales him with stories about how
she had sex with his family. Any pain applied doesn't seem to do too much.

## Immolation

D'zaan and his potential accomplice are immolated at sundown. Before his death,
Ttus speaks once more to D'zaan; he tells Titus he hopes to meet him again.

![Immolation](https://frostmaiden.assimilate.dev/content/images/2021/06/immolation.png)

Jim speaks to a random person and asks him about the duergar threat and the
chardalyn dragon.

Everyone is back to full health save for Fastbatch who has one level of
exhaustion.

Yzma requests D'zaan's ashes and asks about a guide to the tundra.

## Bryn Shander

The party tells Danneth they are going to Bryan Shander. Danneth asks them to
find out what Duvessa knows about Vaelish Gant.

When they arrive they find that Speaker Shane is out of town on business in
Targos and due back the following day. The party speaks instead to the captain
of the guard, Markham Southwell, who is less than friendly. Ultimately he
accepts the explanation regarding Sephek Kaltro. He pays Fastbatch, Jim, and
Thoval.
